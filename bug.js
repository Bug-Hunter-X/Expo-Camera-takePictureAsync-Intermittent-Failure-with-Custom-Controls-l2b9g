This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom camera controls.  The issue is that when attempting to take a photo using the custom controls, the image is not captured or the callback function does not fire. This happens intermittently, making it difficult to debug. The problem doesn't always reproduce, and no consistent error messages are logged in the console. This occurs with both iOS and Android targets.  Here's a code snippet showing the custom controls setup:

```javascript
<Camera style={styles.camera} type={CameraType.back} ref={cameraRef}>
  <View style={styles.controlsContainer}>
    <TouchableOpacity style={styles.captureButton} onPress={takePictureAsync}>
      <Text style={styles.captureButtonText}>Capture</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  </View>
</Camera>
```

And the `takePictureAsync` function:
```javascript
const takePictureAsync = async () => {
  if (cameraRef.current) {
    try {
      const photo = await cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync();
      console.log('Photo taken:', photo);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error taking picture:', error);
    }
  }
};
```
